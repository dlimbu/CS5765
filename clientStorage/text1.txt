fopen
FILE * fopen ( const char * filename, const char * mode );

Open file
Opens the file whose name is specified in the parameter filename and associates it with a stream that can be identified in future operations by the FILE pointer returned.
The operations that are allowed on the stream and how these are performed are defined by the mode parameter.
The returned stream is fully buffered by default if it is known to not refer to an interactive device (see setbuf).
The returned pointer can be disassociated from the file by calling fclose or freopen. All opened files are automatically closed on normal program termination.
The running environment supports at least FOPEN_MAX files open simultaneously.
